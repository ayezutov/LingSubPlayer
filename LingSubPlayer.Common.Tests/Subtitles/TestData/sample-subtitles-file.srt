00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,721
Hey. It's Marshall.

325
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,456
Wanna tell me what's going on?

326
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:30,367
Yes. I was offered ajudgeship in New York.

327
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:35,030
And I took it. Even though
we'd already agreed to move to Rome.

328
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,707
I'm gonna be ajudge.

329
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,804
Lily?

330
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,742
You know, Marshall,
I don't believe in ghosts.

331
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,046
And I'm not sure anyone died in our room.

332
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,849
But someone's going to.

00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:08,569
"And I see in your eyes the emerald reefs
of the primordial seas...

335
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,575
...a- froth with the first stirrings of life,
infinite in mystery and miracle.

336
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:17,738
Forever yours, the guy you met
at the drugstore an hour ago.

337
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,909
I heard you give your address to the
pharmacist while I was buying foot powder."

338
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,079
Yeah.

339
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,859
Mailed it.

340
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,198
No, no, no.
